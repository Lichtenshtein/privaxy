**Forked from the [app version](https://github.com/Barre/privaxy/tree/v0.5.2)**

This reverts it back to [v0.3.1](https://github.com/Barre/privaxy/tree/v0.3.1), but with
newer updates, an improved UI, and server-friendly configuration. To skip to the differences,

## About

Privaxy is a MITM HTTP(s) proxy that sits in between HTTP(s) talking applications, such as a web browser and HTTP servers, such as those serving websites.

By establishing a two-way tunnel between both ends, Privaxy is able to block network requests based on URL patterns and to inject scripts as well as styles into HTML documents.

Operating at a lower level, Privaxy is both more efficient as well as more streamlined than browser add-on-based blockers. A single instance of Privaxy on a small virtual machine, server or even, on the same computer as the traffic is originating from, can filter thousands of requests per second while requiring a very small amount of memory.

Privaxy is not limited by the browserâ€™s APIs and can operate with any HTTP traffic, not only the traffic flowing from web browsers.

Privaxy is also way more capable than DNS-based blockers as it is able to operate directly on URLs and to inject resources into web pages.

## Features

- Suppport for [Adblock Plus filters](https://adblockplus.org/filter-cheatsheet), such as [easylist](https://easylist.to/).
- Web graphical user interface with a statistics display as well as a live request explorer.
- Support for uBlock origin's `js` syntax.
- Support for uBlock origin's `redirect` syntax.
- Support for uBlock origin's scriptlets.
- Browser and HTTP client agnostic.
- Support for custom filters.
- Support for excluding hosts from the MITM pipeline.
- Support for protocol upgrades, such as with websockets.
- Automatic filter lists updates.
- Very low resource usage.
  - Around 50MB of memory with approximately 320 000 filters enabled.
  - Able to filter thousands of requests per second on a small machine.

## Installation

### Using a pre-built binary

**TODO**

## Differences

- You can now specify the address to bind to in the toml config
- You can use environment variables to specify the folder to store the config
- **Adding of custom filters from external sources.** I've added an integration
  to https://filterlists.com in the web gui to search and add filters from there.
- **NotValidBefore** patched properly, slight time differences *will not* produce
  invalid cert messages.


**TODO** more info, screenshots
